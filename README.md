# autoVal
automation of validation in laboratory medicine

With mcr, officedown and RMarkdown.

Data are imported from 4 different worksheets 
within the excel-file "vdata.xlsx".
Two word templates (Formatvorlage & blocks-Akzeptanzkriterien) are used
to generate the final report.


This project was inspired by Daniel Holmes (UBC, CA, https://labrtorian.com/), Burak Bahar (Washington, USA, https://bahar.shinyapps.io/method_compare/) and and David Gohel (Roubaix, F, https://www.ardata.fr/).
